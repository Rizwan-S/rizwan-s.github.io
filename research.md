M.Tech Research Areas: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Sequence Modelling, GRU, LSTM, Word Embeddings

Although I worked extensively with sequence modelling during my master's, I have an urge to explore the further possibilities of using deep learning on digital images and videos as a part of computer vision.

<li> <b>Word Embeddings (Word2Vec Implementation) for Nepali Language</b><br>
Word2Vec implementation of a Nepali language corpora having 100 million running words. The
text corpora was designed by scrapping publicly available news content of various Nepali online
news portals. The model has Word Embeddings for 0.5 million Nepali words.</li><br>


<li> <b>Indian Premier League (IPL) Matches Prediction Model</b><br>
A machine learning model capable of predicting the outcome of an IPL match, 15 minutes before
the gameplay, immediately after the toss results. The prediction model was able to correctly predict
43 out of 60 matches of 2018 season. Project carried out as a part of the course <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>.

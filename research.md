<b>Classifying Emergency Tweets for Disaster Response (J3)</b><br>
This paper was written keeping in view the social science researchers working on disaster research domain at the Special Centre for Disaster Research. With relatively less technicality, the paper focused on how effectively the raw twitter data can be accessed, pre-processed and represented in the Vector Space to enable traditional machine learning algorithms to train on. <br><br>

In both of our works, we've attempted to design global classifiers for classifying disaster-specific tweets. However, the counterparts focus concisely in event-specific classification. We can't afford to wait for a disastrous event to happen for collecting a couple of hundreds of tweets, labelling them, and designing classifier for the event. Therefore, a global classifier seemed lacking, which could classify disaster-specific tweets irrespective of the region and the language.<br>
<br>
The performances of the classifiers in respective papers hold very close to their state-of-art counterparts in terms of classification accuracy.

Word2Vec implementation of a Nepali language corpora having 100 million running words. The
text corpora was designed by scrapping publicly available news content of various Nepali online
news portals. The model has Word Embeddings for 0.5 million Nepali words.</li><br>



<li> <b>Indian Premier League (IPL) Matches Prediction Model</b><br>
A machine learning model capable of predicting the outcome of an IPL match, 15 minutes before
the gameplay, immediately after the toss results. The prediction model was able to correctly predict
43 out of 60 matches of 2018 season. Project carried out as a part of the course <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>.
